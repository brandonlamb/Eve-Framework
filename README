Eve Framework
=======

Heavy use of LiteMVC, modified, then tacked on code from Yii and Zend Framework concepts. I have always liked micro mvc frameworks, but finding the perfect one that had coding standards the way I like (camel case) and whatnot has always been difficult.

I cherry picked some stuff from other frameworks that I like, I think the component idea from Yii was cool so I incorporated some of that.
